Well, unlike his brother Petya, Misha is no longer able to show a simulation of file encryption. 
It goes through the "hey" folder you created, reads the number of files in the ".txt" format and directly encrypts them. 
I know that XOR encryption is not very strong, but I am not an expert in the field of cryptography. Enjoy, The MISCHA RANSOMWARE is in front of you :)))

WARNING! The encryption and decryption of this programm is absolutely unstabilty.
